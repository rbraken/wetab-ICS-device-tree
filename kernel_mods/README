Until I find a way to patch the kernel from a device tree in a nice way,
I will put modified source in this directory.
Just copy them to the kernel tree.

kernel/drivers/platform/x86/asus-laptop.c 
kernel/drivers/bluetooth/ath3k.c
kernel/drivers/bluetooth/btusb.c
kernel/drivers/hid/hid-multitouch.c
kernel/kernel/power/suspend.c
